# Virtual Tourist

Virtual Tourist is a portfolio app for the iOS Developer Nanodegree Program. The original idea was given to the students by Udacity, but the implementation was left completely up to the student. 

Virtual Tourist at its core is an MKMapView that allows users to drop MKAnnotations. After the user drops MKAnnotations and the user clicks on the annotation, each annotation makes a network request to the Flickr API. The Flickr API returns images based on longitude latitude passed by the MKAnnotation
